Zone transfer

dig @10.50.96.5 foocampus.com -t AXFR

Check for dns port open from dns port (sometimes port 53 only responds to port 53)

nmap -sS --source-port 53 -p 53 10.50.97.5 

---------------

nmap -sT -p 53 10.10.10.*

once this is found do

dig @<ipaddress with DNS open> -x <ipaddress with DNS open>

now you should see something like 

answer section
10.5.16.172.in-addr.arpa     1200     IN     PTR     dc01.sportsfoo.com
                                                     -------------------

the sportsfoo.com is the domain name

now you can do

dig@<ipaddress with DNS open> -t AXFR sportsfoo.com  <--this will do a zone transfer with info from above.

------------------------
bash scripts

if zone transfer fails, you can do the following

nmap -sP 172.16.5.* -oG - | awk '/Up/{print $2}' > alive.txt && cat alive.txt

for name in $(cat /usr/share/fierce/hosts.txt); do host $name.sportfoo.com <ipaddress with DNS open> -W 2; done | grep 'has address'


for name in $(cat /usr/share/fierce/hosts.txt); do host $name.sportsfoo.com 172.16.5.10 -W 2; done | grep 'has address'

1: Host Discovery

The Nmap command to perform a ping sweep, and then save the results

into an xml, is the following:

>>nmap –PE –sn -n 10.50.96.0/23 –oX /root/Desktop/scan.xml

where with the -sn we tell nmap to not do a port scan after a host

discovery, the -PE enables ICMP Echo request host discovery (Ping scan)

and with the -oX we tell nmap to save the results into an XML file (in our

case the filename is scan.xml and is located in /root/Desktop).

Option -n is optional and skips DNS reverse lookup on all the IP 
addresses.

Hosts found with this scan are 8:

Host IP address

10.50.96.1
10.50.96.105
10.50.96.110
10.50.96.115
10.50.97.1
10.50.97.5
10.50.97.10
10.50.97.15
10.50.97.20
10.50.97.25

Note that if you use only –sn without –PE nmap uses ICMP requests, but
will also send a TCP SYN packet on ports 80 and 443 of each host

======================

2: Open/Closed/Filtered ports
Hping3 is one of the most powerful packet crafting tools. It’s very easy to

start a TCP communication defining flags to use in order to scan specific

ports and hosts. We want to scan ports 23/53/135 on the address

10.50.97.5. For a SYN scan, we will have to enable the SYN flag, and

according to the response we can determine if a port is

open/close/filtered.

The command to use is:

>>hping3 -S –p 23 10.50.97.5
where:
–S tells the tool to set the SYN flag,
–p option is used to specify the port to scan.

We already know that the host is alive, but if we try the previous

command we will receive no packets. This could happen when there is a

Firewall between us and the target, that blocks our packets.

In the same way as before, let’s use the previous command in order to

scan port 53:

>>hping3 -S –p 53 10.50.97.5
In this case the tool tells us that it received the R flag (Reset) and the A
(Acknowledgement) flag. This means that the port 53 is closed.

The last port to check is 135. The command will look like this:

>>hping3 -S –p 135 10.50.97.5
In this case the flags are S and A, meaning that the port is open.
At the end this is what we have

end result?


Status Port
Open 135
Closed 53
Filtered 23


===========================

3: Hping3: Port scan (TCP)
In order to perform a TCP scan with Hping3 from port 1 to port 1000 we
can use the following option:
>>hping3 10.50.97.5 -S --scan known
This command will scan the most known ports (known includes all the
ports listed in /etc/services) and it will print out information about open
ports, which in our case are 135 and 445.


=============================

4: nmap: Port scan (UDP)
Since the previous scan does not reveal any information about
open/closed/filtered ports used by UDP services, we can use Nmap to
perform an UDP scan and get more information about our target. In order
to do that, we can use the following command:
>>nmap -sU 10.50.97.5
where:
-sU tells nmap to perform an UDP scan.
Note that the open|filtered result means that no response has been
received, and that the port can be open or filtered by a firewall.

====================================

5: Nmap: Port scan (TCP)
In Task 1 we have found a list of alive hosts. We can use this information

to create a ‘.txt’ file that contains the list of IP address to take care 
of.

Once we have created the file, we can give it to Nmap and perform a TCP

SYN scan in order to find open/closed/filtered ports. The command will

look like this:

>>nmap -sS -iL /root/Desktop/list.txt

where:

-sS is the option that tells Nmap to perform the TCP SYN scan

-iL tells Nmap to load the addresses to scan from the file ‘list.txt’

This command will take times. To check the progress of the scan press

the up arrow on your keyboard. 

======================================

6: Source port
Sometimes DNS accepts communication only if it comes from port 53.

This means that all communications with port different from 53 are

blocked by the service or by the firewall. In order to understand if our 

[Scanning] LAB ID: 3

eLearnSecurity s.r.l. © 2012 | H E R A 12

target network this policy is in place, we can set-up nmap or Hping3 to

use port 53 as source port for the scan.

In other words, we have to perform a port scan in the entire network,

from port 53 to port 53.

To do that we can use the following commands:

>>nmap -sS --source-port 53 -p 53 10.50.97.0/24

or

>>hping3 -S -s 53 –k -p 53 10.50.97.25

Note that when you specify a source port, hping takes it as a base port

and increases it at every packet sent. You can use the –k (keep) option to

prevent this behavior. From the results of the previous two commands,

we can see that there is only one host (10.50.97.25) with the port 53

open. This is information that we didn’t find using any of the previous

scans, so make sure to play with source ports during your scans.



=========================================

7: Service detection

In order to accomplish this task, we can set up Nmap in different ways,

depending on the intensity of the scan we want to perform. To perform a

service and version detection with nmap, the option to use is the –sV.

Note that by default the intensity of the scan is set to 7, but you can 
use a

different intensity with the --version-intensity option.

In this case we will show the basic command, but you can use different

options and check the different results yourself. If you need more

information about it, please check out the Nmap man page here:

http://nmap.org/book/man-version-detection.html.

The command will then looks like this:

>>nmap –sV 10.50.97.0/24

Note that Nmap first checks for alive hosts, then performs a port scan and

after that, it performs a service and version detection. Moreover you can

use the –A option to get more information about services and

applications version. This is quite aggressive and will also enable Nmap

scripts.

===================


8: Find a good zombie (Hping3)

[Scanning] LAB ID: 3

eLearnSecurity s.r.l. © 2012 | H E R A 14

In order to find a good zombie, we have to find a host with no active

communications, in other words, we have to check if the host is sending

packets to and from the network. This means that we have to find a host

which its ID field does not change frequently.

To do this we can use Hping3 sending packets to open ports at each host

in the network, using the following command:

>>hping3 -S -r -p 135 10.50.97.10

where:

-S tells hping to send SYN flag

-r displays ID increments relatively

In this way if the ID increments by 1 for each packet (id=+1), means that

the target is not sending packets through the network and is a good

zombie candidate.

Another way to check if the target is a good candidate, is by using nmap.

We can simply run the following command:

>>nmap –O –v –n 10.50.97.10

If the value of “IP ID Sequence Generation” is on ‘Incremental’, we can

consider the target as a good candidate for our idle scan.

=======================

9: Idle Scan
Now that we have the address of a good zombie we can check if the
target hosts have port 23 open :

1) Open a console, Start again the previous Hping scan on the

zombie (Task 9). This will show us ID’s on the fly.

2) Open another console and run the following command:

[Scanning] LAB ID: 3

eLearnSecurity s.r.l. © 2012 | H E R A 15

>>hping3 -a 10.50.97.10 -S -p 23 10.50.96.110

If the zombie ID increment is ‘id=+2’ (Console 1) instead of ‘id=+1’, we 
can

deduce that port 23 on the target 10.50.96.105 is open. Otherwise, if the

ID still increments by 1, we can deduce that the port is closed.
