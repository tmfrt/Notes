Any Host with laps installed will have the following file

AdmPwd.dll

Find the AdmPwd.dll with powershell

gdr -PSProvider 'FileSystem' | %{ls -r $_.root} 2>$null | where { $_.name -eq "AdmPwd.dll"} -verbose

Get-ChildItem ‘c:\program files\LAPS\CSE\Admpwd.dll’

With PowerView, search for any GPO that has LAPS in the display name (Master Branch)

Get-DomainGPO -Identity "*LAPS*"

Within PowerView, see who has read access to ms-Mcs-AdmPwd (LAPS) 

Get-NetOU -FullData | Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs |
Where-Object {
($_.ObjectType -like 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd') -and
($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'ReadProperty')
}

Get-NetOU -FullData | Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | Where-Object { ($_.ObjectType -like 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd') -and ($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'ReadProperty') }

Find who has extended rights over computers/servers/workstations

*****This will give us a list, such as AppServers, Domain Controllers, etc.
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights -Identity "*" | fl  

Now we can use that list to find what we want to enumerate e.g.,

Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights -Identity "Domain Controllers" | fl


Using PowerView, Get a list of all Object ACLs for OUs of interest (and resolve GUIDs to their display names)
Filter on ActiveDirectory Rights for ReadProperty
Filter on ObjectAceType for ms-Mcs-AdmPwd

Get-DomainObjectAcl -SearchBase "LDAP://OU=Workstations,DC=testlab,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | Where-Object { $_.ObjectAceType -eq "ms-Mcs-AdmPwd" -and $_.A
ctiveDirectoryRights -like "*ReadProperty*" } | Select-Object ObjectDN, SecurityIdentifier

Get-DomainObjectAcl -SearchBase "LDAP://OU=Workstations,DC=testlab,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | Where Object { $_.ObjectAceType -eq "ms-Mcs-AdmPwd" -and $_.ActiveDirectoryRights -like "*ReadProperty*" } | Select-Object ObjectDN, SecurityIdentifier
