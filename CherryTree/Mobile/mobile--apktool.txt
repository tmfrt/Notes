APKTOOL
In order to reverse an APK, do the following

java -jar apktool_2.1.1.jar d <apkname.apk>

Keep in mind that the "d" option will decode the APK

The resulting output will be a directory with the AndroidManifest.xml

SOMETIMES THERE IS MORE THAN ONE ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML FILE SO DEBUGGING THE APK CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO READ THE FINAL ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML FILE
