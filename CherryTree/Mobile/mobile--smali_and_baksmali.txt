SMALI AND BAKSMALI
Smali and Baksmali are programs that are considered assemblers and disassemblers.

These programs will turn bytecode, which is almost unreadable into assembly code - Which is more human readable.

Baksmali
-------------
Now lets take a look on how to turn a .dex file into a

java -jar baksmali-2.1.1.jar <dex-file.dex>

After running this command, the output results will be placed into a directory called out.

In the out folder, there will be files called <file-name.smali>  Open one of these files and you will see some code that is somewhat readable and similar to Java.

Smali

This program is the opposite of Baksmali, this program will take smali code, and create a .dex file.

here is the command

java -jar smali-2.1.1.jar source-directory-containing-smali-code/
