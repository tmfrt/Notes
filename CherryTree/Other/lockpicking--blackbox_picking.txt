BLACKBOX PICKING
Use lubricant to loosen up lock

Use tensioner or similar tool to check if the core can still remain free.  Move the tensioner back and forth to make sure there is rotation

Run pick or hook through pinning to make sure there isn't any glue, or debris in the key way while you pick - this will also help loosen up any potentially frozen pins

Run a pick to check for how many pins are available

Once you know how many pins are there, that the keyway is clear, and the core can be rotated, hack stuff

start with rocking - use a lifter

then move to raking - use a bogota triple rake or a bogata double eork - the bogata snake rake works
